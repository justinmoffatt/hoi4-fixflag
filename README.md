## About
A python script for renaming the Hearts of Iron 4 flag files that do not display on Linux or MacOS. Since directories in Linux and MacOS are case sensitive, the flags for formable nations in the Waking the Tiger DLC do not show up. In the game code it references capitalized names but the actual files are all lower case. They work fine on Windows since Windows is not case sesitive.

## Usage
Change the ```dir``` variable to where the folder for the Hearts of Iron 4 flags are kept. Probably something like ```.../steam/steamapps/common/Hearts of Iron IV/gfx/flags```. This is a long way of saying change the ```...```.
